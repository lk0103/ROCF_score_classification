## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an end-to-end automated system for evaluating performance on the Reyâ€“Osterrieth Complex Figure test. Leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision and artificial intelligence methods. The system currently:

- **Preprocesses input images** to enhance the drawing and remove noise.  
- **Trains Multiple Image Classifiers** that classify each drawing into one of four categories (Class 0: least similar; Class 1: moderately similar; Class 2: similar; Class 3: very similar) through comprehensive hyperparameter testing of both ResNetâ€‘18 and Swin Transformer architectures.

This approach aims to provide clinicians and researchers with a faster, more consistent, and scalable way to score ROCF tests, ultimately enhancing the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological and psychiatric memory disorders.

## Description of the scripts
+ ***ROCFDataset_for_CNN.py***:
Loads raw images, handles preprocessing steps (noise reduction, resizing, normalization), and includes common image-related functionality used across the project.

+ ***Resnet18_experiments.py***:
Implements training pipelines for ResNetâ€‘18 on the ROCF dataset. Supports hyperparameter search, saves model checkpoints and result summaries, and generates heatmap visualizations that show the impact of occluding each square patch (replacing it with a black square) on the softmax output for the correct class.

+ ***Swin_experiments.py***: 
Similar to Resnet18_experiments.py, but uses a Swin Transformer backbone. Includes hyperparameter search, checkpoint saving, and performance logging.

+ ***Swin_experiments_test.py***: 
A streamlined script to load a preâ€‘trained Swin transformer model and evaluate it on the test set, producing accuracy metrics.

+ ***orezane_1500x1500px/***: 
Contains dataset images, all resized and cropped to 1500Ã—1500 pixels.

+ ***Results of experiments***: 
Stores output from experiments, including:

  - Model training logs, checkpoint files and graphs of validation accuracy and loss during training for different hyperparameter configurations (/old_experiments, /resnet18_4outputs, /swin_transformer, /swin-trans-not-learning).

  - Heatmap visualizations highlighting which image regions contribute most to correct classifications (/heatmap_visualization, /heatmap_results).

  - Statistical analysis outputs (e.g., proportion of pixels containing drawn elements per class, average grayscale pixel intensity distributions) - /pixel_count_analysis.

+ ***Outline of the Master's thesis***:
Stores LaTeX structure of the Master's thesis (ROCF_master_thesis_latex.zip), its PDF version (ROCF_master_thesis.pdf) and presentation of current progress (ROCF_classification_PS1_Korbelova_final.pptx)
