## 📋 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an end-to-end automated system for evaluating performance on the Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure test. Leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision and artificial intelligence methods. The system has the following functionality:
 
- **Training of multiple image classifiers**: models classify each drawing into one of four categories (Class 0: least similar, score 0-14.5; Class 1: moderately similar, score 15-22; Class 2: similar, score 22.5-30; Class 3: very similar, score 30.5-36) or one of 6 categories (Class 0: score 0-6; Class 1: score 6-12; Class 2: score 12-18; Class 3: score 18-24; Class 4: score 24-30; Class 3: score 30-36) through comprehensive hyperparameter testing of both ResNet‑18 and Swin Transformer architectures.
- **Augmentation of training images**: one of the hyperparameters selects the augmentation applied to images in the training dataset. Six augmentation modes are available::
    - No augmentation
    - Random crop
    - Random translation
    - Random rotation
    - Random color brightness and contrast
    - A combination of random translation, rotation, and color brightness/contrast
- **Ability to add image preprocessing in the future**: the system is designed to easily incorporate improved preprocessing methods later.
- **Evaluation of results on validation or test set**: comprehensive evaluation of model performance, including multiple metrics. The system computes loss, accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, the confusion matrix, MAE, and records all misclassified images on the validation and test sets. On the test set, it also evaluates performance in a test-time augmentation mode: for each image, five versions are sent to the model—one unmodified, one rotated, one translated, one with altered brightness/contrast, and one combining all three augmentations. The final prediction is the majority vote across the five outputs.

This approach aims to provide clinicians and researchers with a faster, more consistent, and scalable way to score ROCF tests, ultimately enhancing the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological and psychiatric memory disorders.

## Description of the scripts
+ ***ROCFDataset_for_CNN.py***:
Loads raw images, handles preprocessing steps (noise reduction, resizing, normalization), and includes common image-related functionality used across the project.

+ ***Resnet18_experiments.py***:
Implements training pipelines for ResNet-18 on the ROCF dataset, supports hyperparameter search, saves model checkpoints and result summaries with graphs, and uses Grad-CAM to generate the most significant image regions that influence the final prediction.

+ ***Swin_experiments.py***: 
Similar to Resnet18_experiments.py, but uses a Swin Transformer backbone. Includes hyperparameter search, checkpoint saving, and performance logging.

+ ***Swin_experiments_test.py***: 
A streamlined script to load a pre‑trained Swin transformer model and evaluate it on the test set, producing performance metrics.

+ ***AnalysisImagesInFourCategories.py***:
Computes dataset and class-level statistics, including a histogram of image counts by score and the average number of drawing pixels in the four classes.

+ ***GeneralResNetTraining.py***:
Contains all shared training and evaluation code used for both the ResNet-18 and Swin Transformer models.

+ ***orezane_1500x1500px/***: 
Contains dataset images, all resized and cropped to 1500×1500 pixels.

+ ***Directories with results***: 
Stores output from experiments, including:

  - Model training logs, checkpoint files, and graphs of validation accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and loss for different hyperparameter configurations (/old_experiments, /resnet_new_results, /transformer_new_resutls).

  - Heatmap visualizations highlighting which image regions contribute most to correct classifications (/heatmap_visualization, /heatmap_results).
 
  - Grad-CAM visualizations highlighting the regions most influential for the final classification (/grad-cam_results).

  - Statistical analysis outputs (e.g., proportion of pixels containing drawn elements per class, average grayscale intensity distributions) (/pixel_count_analysis).
 
  - Dataset-level statistics (e.g., histogram of image counts by score and phase of the ROCF test) (/dataset_stats).

+ ***Outline of the Master's thesis***:
Stores LaTeX structure of the Master's thesis (ROCF_master_thesis_latex.zip), its PDF version (ROCF_master_thesis.pdf) and presentation of current progress (ROCF_classification_PS1_Korbelova_final.pptx, ROCF_classification_PS2_Korbelova.pptx)
